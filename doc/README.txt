WHAT WORKS

Our login and signup works the way they should act, and we have a continue as guest button that would allow users to choose
to either signup, signin, or continue as guest. Our feed and profiles page are unique to each user as you can see the user's
followings liked and saved recipes on the feed. The profile shows the user's fans correctly and displays the user's saved
and uploaded recipes. We are also able to search by tags and recipe name (searches would show all matching recipes).
Additionally, each recipe page is unique showing the number of likes each recipe has, how to make the recipe, and the option
of saving and liking recipes. The create recipes page also allows users to make their own recipes and sharing it to others.
Users are able to input the ingredients, instructions, add tags, an image, and a name.


WHAT DOESN'T

The fan button works in that it updates to the database correctly and the page would load so that it would update
the fans, but the button would not change its value. (It would stay as 'Become a fan' even after the button is
pressed). Our mulithreading doesn't work for multiple users. We have notifications working, but only for the 
one user, so it does not recognize that other users are logged in and can like and save recipes.
